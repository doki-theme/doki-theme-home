She now has a new top-tier dark hacker theme: \`Obsidian\`. I also felt like Red Zero Two doesn't get enough attention, so I added a light \`Sakura\` theme which features her as she was as a child. With all these new Zero Two themes, I thought it would be best to rename the existing dark & light themes to \`Rose\` & \`Lily\` respectively.\n- I also went ahead and added Hiro as well. (Dark Theme)\n- Lastly, this is the first release with a duo theme! (Nao's doesn't count, I just wanted the melon meme.) Just to pad my Zero Two theme stats, I've now got a Hiro & Zero Two couples' dark theme.\n\n### Other Stuff\n\n- Desaturated Itsuki's theme a bit.\n- Adjusted CC's inlay color.\n- Fixed differentiation fo un-versioned files in VCS.\n- Allowed you to opt-out of promotional content.\n- Changed [Anime Meme Plugin](https://github.com/ani-memes/AMII) promotion to a notification.\n- It was brought to my attention that I cannot spell "Rimuru".\n`

You can almost feel the "„Åä„Åã„Åà„Çä„Å™„ÅÆ„Åò„ÇÉ" you will never get üò≠\n- I decided to complete my Quintessential Quintuplets collection by adding the oldest and youngest quint: Nakano Ichika & Nakano Itsuki.\n- Tomori Nao, from Charlotte, has an interesting dichotomy when it comes to her personality. She is super cute tho.\n- Have I ever seen Code Geass? No. Can I appreciate C.C. without having seen the anime? Yeah buddy.\n- Guess while I'm talking about "anime I haven't seen but, chose to make a theme because the girl is pretty."
